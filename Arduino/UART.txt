What is UART?

A serial communication protocol to transmit data between two devices.  
Every bit sent, could be imagined like actuating an output with +5v and 0Vin sequence.
If you actuate and deactuate it at a certain speed, and accumulate every certain number of bits together
(say 4 bits). You get the message. 
E.g:
-Send bits in sequence: 1010
-The time interval between every bit is fixed

-//-
-Consist of 8 data bits
-1 Start bit
-One or two stop bits
